# morphcast-demo

## Getting started

Firstly, [generate a license key](https://www.morphcast.com/sdk-licence-request/) for MorphCast SDK and insert into the configuration snippet.

You can find the configuration of the MorphCast SDK, under:

* `src/helpers/ai-sdk/loader.js`

The **start()** / **stop()** controls of the MorphCast SDK are inside the App.js:

* `src/App.js`
